Questions?
1. how to show the response of assets in tabular format (instructions = [Use tables to display data])

2. How the knowledge (weights and biases ) stored as files?

3. Can we adjust biases directly without training?

4. inferential

The term inferential is commonly used in the fields of statistics, data science, and artificial intelligence. 
It refers to the process of drawing conclusions or making predictions about a larger population or dataset based on a smaller sample 
or a model's learned patterns.

Inferential Statistics:
Involves using sample data to make generalizations about a population.
Relies on probability theory to estimate or test hypotheses.

5. How to turn data (facts) into information?

Statistics:
 - Descriptive
 - Inferential / Predective
Probability
Machine Learning
 - Supervised
 - Unsupervised


6. Data Science - Using data to make decision
- How do we do this?
 - Acquire or generate data
 - Clean and preprocess data
 - organize data
 - Generate descriptive or inferencial results
Ultimately extract insights

7. Difference between langchain and phidata?
LangChain is best suited for developers who want flexibility in building custom LLM-driven workflows, chatbots, or retrieval-based systems.
PhiData is ideal for data and operations teams looking for a streamlined platform to manage, deploy, and monitor AI workflows

Example Use Cases
LangChain :
1.Chatbot Development	Build a conversational agent with memory.	
2.RAG (Search + AI)	Integrate with vector stores for RAG.	
3.AI Workflow Automation	Supports custom toolchains but manual setup.
4.Enterprise Analytics	Requires custom integration.	
PhiData:
1.Less suited for this use case.
2.Limited out-of-the-box support for RAG.
3.Simplifies pipeline automation.
4.Built for analytics and decision-making.
